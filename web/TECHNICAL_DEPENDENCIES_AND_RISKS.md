|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **External Services** |                                                                                   |                                            |                                                            |
| Stripe            | Payment processing integration using Stripe API                                    | Dependency on external service availability | Fallback mechanisms and retries                            |
| Email Provider    | Email service for notifications (e.g., SMTP, SendGrid)                             | Risk of emails not being delivered on time | Use of backup email services and monitoring                |
| **Schema Migrations** | Supabase migrations for database schema evolution                                   | Potential data loss during migrations      | Plan, test migrations in a staging environment first       |
| **RLS Policies**  | Row Level Security enabled for data isolation in a multi-tenant architecture | Misconfigured policies leading to data breaches | Regular audits and automated tests for policy verifications |
| **Identified Risks** |                                                                                   |                                            |                                                            |
| Multi-Tenant Security | Data isolation may fail, exposing one tenant's data to another                       | Implement comprehensive RLS rules and continuous testing    |
| Performance       | Performance bottlenecks with concurrent user growth                                | Load testing and monitoring, optimizing queries and indexes |
